# Laundry Manager and Optimizer

The Laundry Manager and Optimizer was envisioned as an Internet of Things hamper that recognizes the laundry symbols (instructions) on clothing tags. It then sorts clothing articles into one of four sections so users can easily wash the right types of clothes together, thus preventing wear-and-tear.

Built by [Spencer Ng](https://github.com/spencerng) and [Kevin Tang](https://github.com/icevin) for their senior capstone project at the Middlesex County Academy for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Technologies. [The project's prototype](https://devpost.com/software/load-optimization-assistance-device) was a Top 30 Hack winner at PennApps XVIII.
